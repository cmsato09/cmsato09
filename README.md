# Hello there, my name is Chris 👋

I'm a scientist-turned-software engineer 🧪💻 (when in Silicon Valley, do as the technologists do). Currently, my focus is backend with Python and I'm continuosly learning and expanding my skills with all things software.

While working at a battery company, I collaborated with contract programmers, providing feedback on the database interface and testing software that was a part of my work. One thing I'll always remember is a certain response from one of those programmers. I would explain what we wanted and asked if it was possible and the response was always "Chris, **Anything is possible.**" So one thought kept coming back, "Why can't I code? Shouldn't *I* be able to do it?"

I started to learn Python during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the world was locked down and I was furloughed. Great part about coding is you can learn from anywhere (where there's internet access) and try anything in your IDE. I was learning little by little by myself and it got to the point I didn't know what I should be doing. That's when I took a big step and asked for help by joining a coaching program. By observing how a software developer work, think, and look at code, I was able to make a lot of progress.
