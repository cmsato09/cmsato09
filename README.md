# Hello there, my name is Chris 👋

I'm a scientist-turned-software engineer 🧪💻 (when in Silicon Valley, do as the technologists do). My main focus is Fullstack and I'm continuosly learning and expanding my skills with all things software.

While working at a battery company, I collaborated with contract programmers, providing feedback on the database interface and testing software that was a part of my work. One thing I'll always remember is a certain response from one of those programmers. I would explain what we wanted and asked if it was possible and the response was always "Chris, **Anything is possible.**" So one thought kept coming back, "Why can't I code? Shouldn't *I* do it?"

I started to learn Python during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the world was locked down and I was furloughed. Great part about coding is you can learn from anywhere (where there's internet access) and try anything in your IDE.
