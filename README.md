# Hello there, My name is Chris ğŸ‘‹

I'm a scientist-turned-software engineer ğŸ§ªğŸ’» (when in Silicon Valley, do as the technologists do). My main focus is Python, and I'm continuosly learning and expanding my skills with all things software.

While working at a battery company, I collaborated with contract programmers, providing feedback on the database interface and testing software that was central to my work. One thing I can't forget about is a response from one of those programmers. I would explain what we wanted and asked if it was possible and the response was always **"Chris, Anything is possible."** And while that was true, it often took time time for a fix. As I worked with them, one thought kept coming back, "Why can't I code? Shouldn't I be able to?"

I started to learn Python during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the world was locked down and I was furloughed. Many people who could work from home could still work, while I was stuck at home. Never again.
